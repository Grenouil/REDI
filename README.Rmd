The *REDI* package implements the Robust Exponential Decreasing Index (REDI). It represents a measure of cumulated workload, is robust to missing data and provides control of the decreasing influence of the workload over time. 

*REDI* provides various functions to format data, compute REDI and visualise results in a simple and convenient way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of REDI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Grenouil/REDI")
```

## REDI in a nutshell

Here is a basic example on how to simulate a dataset with the adequate format, compute REDI values over time and display results.

```{r REDI_in_a_nutshell}
library(REDI)
set.seed(42)
## Generate a synthetic dataset with the correct format
data = simu_db()

data

## Compute REDI over all observations for different Lambda values and display results
res = redi(data)

res

```
## Detailed workflow
For a advanced use of the package, here is a quick step-by-step guide.

### Data simulation

In order to test different features of the package, the `simu_db()` function is provided as a handy way to generate synthetic data with the correct format for subsequent REDI computations. 

```{r generate data REDI}
set.seed(42)
## Generate a synthetic dataset, containing dates (Inputs) from '2022-01-01' to '2023-01-01' and observations (Outputs) following a Gaussian distribution (mean = 50, var = 10), with 50% of missing values.
simu_data <- simu_db(start_date = '2022-01-01',
    end_date = '2023-01-01',
    by = 'day',
    output_distrib = 'Gaussian',
    ratio_missing = 0.5,
    mean = 50,
    var = 10)

simu_data
```

As displayed above, any dataset processed in REDI should provide 2 columns: one corresponding to `Input` values (*e.g.* time) and another to `Output` values (*e.g.* workload).

### Convert a dataset to the correct format with `format_data()`

However, a real-life dataset will generally not have the correct format to compute REDI directy. Therefore, the `format_data()` function is designed to help with this process by identifying the columns corresponding to the Input (e.g the date) and the Output (e.g. the workload) variables. The Input column should be defined with a correct `Date` type.  The function will automatically identify missing values between each observations, considering the `by` argument as the time increment (for instance with 'day', the default, each day between two observed dates is considered missing). Finally, Output values for duplicated Input values can be summarised according to the `summarise_duplicate` argument. 

```{r format_dataset}

## Create a dummy real-life dataset 
raw_db <- data.frame(
  'Var1' = 1:100, 
  'Var2' = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 50, sd = 10), 
  'Var3' = c(
    as.Date("2022/1/1"), 
    seq(from = as.Date("2022/1/3"), by = "day", length.out = 99)
    )
  )

head(raw_db)

## Convert the dataset to the correct format (adding the missing data point on 2022-01-02) 
db <- format_data(
    data = raw_db,
    input = 'Var3',
    output = 'Var2',
    by = 'day',
    format = '%Y%m%d'
    )

db
```


### Computation of REDI with `compute_redi()`
To compute a single REDI value, simply use the `compute_redi()` function. It will correspond to the REDI value for the most recent observed Input in the dataset, using all data from the past. Feel free to adapt the $\lambda$ coefficient, controlling the exponential decay of weights over time, depending on the context. 

```{r compute_REDI}

## Compute REDI at the current date (2022-04-11 in this example)
compute_redi(db, coef = 0.05)

max(db$Input)
```

### Computation multiple REDI values over time with `loop_redi()`

To sequentially compute REDI for all `Input` values in the dataset with speed-up vectorised operations, one can use the `loop_redi()` function. 

```{r compute_REDI_via_loop_redi}
## Apply loop_redi() to tcompute REDI for all dates in the dataset 
db_redi <- loop_redi(data = db, coef = 0.5)

db_redi
```

### Display results with `plot_redi()`
The `plot_redi()` function is proposed to display the results, and provides several options to personalise the graphs.
```{r plot_REDI}
## Display results as time series of REDI values
plot_redi(redi = db_redi,
          x_axis = 'Date',
          y_axis = 'Workload',
          plot_data = TRUE)
```

One can customise graphs by:

- changing the name of the axis by replacing the default values of `x_axis` and `y_axis`;
- masking the original data in black points by setting `plot_data` to `FALSE`.

### Full workflow with the wrapper function `redi()`

As presented in the nutshell example, all the previous steps (formatting, computations, plotting) are wrapped into the `redi()` function. In addition to the arguments of the previous functions, it is also possible to provide a vector to the `coef` argument to display results for different $\lambda$ values. 

```{r wrapper_REDI}
## Apply redi() on db and provide a vector of coefficients.
db_full_redi <- redi(data = db, coef = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), plot = TRUE)

db_full_redi
```
