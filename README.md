# REDI-package-master
Implementation of the Robust Exponential Decreasing Index (REDI), proposed in the article by Issa Moussa, Arthur Leroy et al. (2019) <https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/bmjosem/5/1/e000573.full.pdf>.
The REDI represents a measure of cumulated workload, robust to missing data, providing control of the decreasing influence of workload over time. 
Various functions are provided to format data, compute REDI, and visualise results in a simple and convenient way.
